Add the portal concept (#249): a second, fully isolated auth boundary for customers/members, a declarative route guard, and the chrome to hang an account area on.

coracle and ghostfire **independently** arrived at the same design — two Better Auth instances on one origin and one D1 — which is what makes it worth owning. The studio instance keeps Better Auth's defaults (`/api/auth`, unprefixed tables) because the Louise editor client hardcodes them, so the portal is the one that moves: `/api/portal-auth`, a `portal` cookie prefix, and `portal_*` tables. Those three are fixed by Astroid rather than configurable, because getting any of them wrong means two instances fighting over one origin's cookies — a failure that is intermittent, looks like a session bug rather than a config one, and only shows up once both are in use.

**The guard is a table, not a call.** `routes` maps a path prefix to the roles allowed through, matched first-wins. Declarative because a guard you have to remember to write in each page is a guard someone eventually forgets, and the page that forgets is the one that leaks. Three answers, each chosen for what it does to the caller:

- signed out + HTML → redirect to login carrying `next`
- signed out + `/api/*` → **401 JSON**, never a redirect: redirecting `fetch()` to an HTML login page returns 200 and a page of markup, which client code reads as success and then fails somewhere far less obvious
- wrong role + HTML → bounce to the area this user *does* have, not back to login, which would claim their credentials failed when they worked fine

Prefix matching is on a segment boundary, so `/portal` guards `/portal/orders` but not the public `/portalling`.

**One session lookup per request.** The middleware resolves it to gate, and the handler that runs next resolves it to know who's asking — two D1 round-trips on every authenticated request otherwise. `resolvePortalSession` shares the in-flight *promise* via a `WeakMap` keyed on the `Request`, so entries disappear with the request rather than needing eviction.

`requireCustomer` adds what a session alone doesn't: a same-origin check on mutations. The cookie proves identity, the origin proves intent — a browser attaches that cookie to a request a third-party page triggered too. It's checked *before* the session lookup, so a cross-origin attempt costs nothing.

`PortalShell` + `definePortalNav()` ship the chrome: theme-tokened (daisyUI tokens, restyled via the theme rather than a fork), role-filtered before render so an unreachable item is never drawn as a dead link, and the mobile menu is a `<details>` element — no island, no hydration wait, and keyboard/Escape behaviour from the browser.

`louise-toolkit` gains the mechanism this needs: `basePath` and `cookiePrefix` on `LouiseAuthConfig` (a second instance is impossible without them), `disableSignUp` / `sendResetPassword` / `revokeSessionsOnPasswordReset` for a credential portal, and a `guard` hook on `createLouiseMiddleware` that runs after `extend` populates locals and **outside** its try/catch — a guard exists to refuse, so an error inside it must fail closed rather than be swallowed into "render the protected page".

`create-astroid --portal` scaffolds the instance, its mounted catch-all, the `App.Locals` type, and a second prefixed auth migration. That migration matters: without it a portal scaffold looks complete, type-checks, builds, and fails on the first sign-in with a missing table — so it's emitted on both the generated and the fallback path.

Verified in a clean room: a `--portal` scaffold type-checks with 0 errors, builds, and its two auth table sets are fully disjoint (`user`/`session`/… vs `portal_user`/`portal_session`/…).
